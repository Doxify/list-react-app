# list-react-app
The idea behind the app is that you can create a list without registering and anyone you share the list with can then collaborate with you.

This project is currently a work in progress.

## Goal:
The goal behind this project is really to just get familiar with WebSockets and React.

## Features:
* ~~Create an API w/ Express~~
* Create the front-end with React
* Implement WebSockets

### Todo:
* Figure out where the port for the API is set
* Make API not start if database is offline
* Create some sort of list creation cooldown to prevent abuse [future]
