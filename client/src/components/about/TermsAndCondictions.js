        <p>To put it simply, collaborative lists is an app that allows you to quickly create a list from anywhere. Since the website is mobile friendly, you can easily create a new list and share it with someone on your computer, phone, or anywhere you can access a browser.</p>
        
        <h4 className="mt-5">Is it really free?</h4>
        <p>Yes, as long as it doesn't get excessively expensive to run everyone will be able to create and collaborate on an unlimited amount of lists for free. There may come a time where some features become paid, but that's only if they are extremely different from the base feature-set.</p>

        <h4 className="mt-5">How can I create my own list?</h4>
        <p>Click <Link to="/lists/create">here</Link> to create a new list.</p>

        <h4 className="mt-5">Will you ever delete my list?</h4>
        <p>As of right now -- no, but in the future I will delete lists that haven't been interacted with in a long period of time.</p>

        <h4 className="mt-5">Who created this app?</h4>
        <p>Collaborative Lists was created by <a href="https://github.com/doxify">Andrei Georgescu</a>. </p>

        <h4 className="mt-5">Who created the art?</h4>
        <p>The artwork on this website is from <a href="https://manypixels.co">manypixels</a>. </p> */}
